# Bobbit — Debugging Guide

Scannable checklists for common issues. Each entry: symptom → where to look → key detail.

## Streaming performance (UI sluggishness)

- **Architecture**: `StreamingMessageContainer` owns rendering during streaming via `setMessage()` with `requestAnimationFrame` batching. `AgentInterface` must NOT call `this.requestUpdate()` in the `message_update` event handler — only the streaming container updates on each token.
- **If the UI feels sluggish during streaming**: check `AgentInterface.setupSessionSubscription()` — the `message_update` case should only update the streaming container, not trigger a full `AgentInterface` re-render.
- **Markdown content throttle**: `AssistantMessage._getThrottledContent()` limits `<markdown-block>` `.content` updates to ~4x/sec (250ms) during streaming. This prevents `MarkdownBlock.render()` — which runs `marked.parse()` on the full text, reconfigures parser extensions, and does regex-heavy HTML escaping — from executing on every rAF frame. Without this throttle, HTML-heavy streaming responses cause main-thread jank because each `marked.parse()` call grows more expensive as content accumulates. The throttle uses the same pattern as `WriteRenderer._getThrottledCode()`: snapshot the content on first call, start a 250ms cooldown timer, and return the snapshot until the timer expires. A 20-character prefix check detects message identity changes (e.g. the element is reused for a different message) and resets the throttle immediately. When `isStreaming` flips to false, the timer is cleared in `render()` so the final content is always rendered accurately.
- **Text appears laggy or stale during streaming?** The 250ms throttle means visible text trails the actual streamed content by up to 250ms — this is intentional and barely perceptible. If text appears significantly more stale than that, check: (1) `_contentThrottleTimer` is being cleared when `isStreaming` becomes false, (2) the prefix-based identity reset in `_getThrottledContent()` is firing correctly when switching between messages, (3) no additional throttle or debounce has been added upstream in `StreamingMessageContainer`.
- **toolResultsById memoization**: `AgentInterface._getToolResultsById()` caches the tool-results Map to avoid creating a new reference on every render, which would cause `MessageList` to re-render unnecessarily.
- **content-visibility CSS**: `message-list > .flex > *` uses `content-visibility: auto` to skip layout/paint for off-screen messages in long conversations.
- State-transition events (`message_start`, `message_end`, `agent_start`, `agent_end`, `turn_start`, `turn_end`) still call `requestUpdate()` — only `message_update` (the hot path) is excluded.

## Duplicate messages

- Check `flushDeferredMessage()` and `_deferredAssistantMessage` in `remote-agent.ts`
- `MessageList` renders `state.messages` (completed); `StreamingMessageContainer` renders `state.streamMessage` (in-progress) — they must never overlap
- Tool-call messages stay in streaming until the next message starts

## Session connection issues

- Session creation logic lives in `session-setup.ts` (pipeline steps + executors) and `session-manager.ts` (thin wrappers)
- `executePlan()` runs the full pipeline synchronously for normal/delegate sessions
- `executeWorktreeAsync()` runs asynchronously for worktree sessions (fire-and-forget, returns immediately with `status: "preparing"`)
- `handleSetupFailure()` in `session-setup.ts` handles cleanup on pipeline errors
- `subscribeToEvents()` is the shared event subscription function across all session types
- `connectToSession()` in `session-manager.ts` creates ChatPanel before `remote.connect()`
- Model + WebSocket connect run in parallel via `Promise.all`
- `switchGeneration` / `isStale()` invalidates in-flight work on rapid switches
- On connect failure, `state.chatPanel` is cleared (prevents stuck spinner)
- `model` and `thinkingLevel` synced from server's `get_state` response on connect/reconnect

## Session/goal refresh not updating

- Both stores track a `generation` counter; clients pass `?since=N` to skip unchanged data
- Check `sessionsGeneration` and `goalsGeneration` in `state.ts`
- Server returns `{ changed: false }` when generation matches

## Gate status stale

- `state.gateStatusCache` refreshed via: (1) `refreshGateStatusCache()` on initial load, (2) `refreshGateStatusForGoal()` on WS events `gate_status_changed` / `gate_verification_complete`
- Dashboard gate polling also syncs to this cache

## Context bar / model state

After a server restart, the context bar may show wrong info (e.g. 200k instead of 1M) or nothing at all. This happens because the agent process's `getState()` RPC may fail or return incomplete data before the process is fully ready.

- **Server-side fallback**: `sendFallbackModelState()` in `handler.ts` reads persisted `modelProvider`/`modelId` from the session store and calls `inferMeta()` to attach the correct `contextWindow`. This runs when `getState()` fails, is skipped (dormant/preparing sessions), or returns data without model metadata.
- **Client-side retry**: `remote-agent.ts` retries `get_state` after 3s on reconnect if `contextWindow` is still 0.
- **Default contextWindow is 0**: Before the server provides real data, `contextWindow` starts at 0 (not 200k), so the context bar shows nothing rather than a misleading value.
- If context bar still shows wrong info after restart, check that `modelProvider` and `modelId` are persisted in `<project-root>/.bobbit/state/sessions.json` for the affected session.
- `SessionManager.getPersistedSession(id)` exposes persisted session data used by the fallback mechanism.

## Session persistence

- Check `<project-root>/.bobbit/state/sessions.json` (per-project, not centralized)
- Initial persist happens via `persistOnce()` in `session-setup.ts` — a single `store.put()` with all structural fields at creation time
- `persistSessionMetadata()` only calls `store.update()` (never `store.put()`) — updates `agentSessionFile` once the agent reports it
- `persistSessionMetadata()` retries 3 times with backoff (500ms, 1s, 2s) on failure
- `sandboxed` is a typed field on `SessionInfo` (no `(session as any)._sandboxed` hack)
- `restoreSessions()` in `session-manager.ts` skips sessions with missing `.jsonl` files
- Failed restores create dormant entries that revive on client connect
- **Server restarts are safe** — restarting the gateway never deletes worktrees, terminates sessions, or purges archives. All agent work survives intact. Orphaned resources can be cleaned up manually via Settings → Maintenance tab or the `/api/maintenance/*` REST endpoints.

## Abort, steer & queue

- **Session status values**: `idle`, `streaming`, `preparing`, `dormant`, `terminated`, and `aborting`. The `aborting` status is broadcast immediately when the user clicks Stop — it covers the up-to-3s grace period before a force-kill. UI shows an "Aborting..." spinner during this state.
- **Steered messages lost after abort?** Steered messages are deferred — they stay in the queue until `drainQueue()` runs after the agent becomes idle. If steers appear lost after a force-kill, check that `resetDispatched()` was called before `drainQueue()` in the restart path. Without it, messages marked `dispatched` from a pre-kill drain attempt won't be retried.
- **Steered messages arriving one-at-a-time instead of batched?** `drainQueue()` batches all consecutive steered messages at the front of the queue via `dequeueAllSteered()`. If they arrive separately, check that the messages are all marked `steered: true` and are contiguous at the front of the queue (non-steered messages in between will break the batch).
- **Draft lost on rapid session switch?** The client awaits any in-flight `_pendingSave` promise before loading the draft for the new session. If drafts are still lost, check that `_flushDraft()` is returning its save promise and that `_setupPromptDraftHandlers()` awaits it.
- **Draft not restoring after session switch?** Draft restore uses a `requestAnimationFrame` retry loop (up to 5 frames) to survive Lit re-renders that reset the editor value. If the draft still doesn't appear, check that the rAF `reapply` callback is firing (add a `console.log` inside it) and that `_draftSessionId` hasn't been nulled by a concurrent session switch.
- See [prompt-queue.md](prompt-queue.md) for the full queue architecture and [prompt-queue.md — Abort and force-kill recovery](prompt-queue.md#abort-and-force-kill-recovery) for the force-kill flow.

## Compaction

- Check `_isCompacting`, `_compactionSyntheticMessages`, `_usageStaleAfterCompaction` in `remote-agent.ts`
- `compacting_placeholder` must be filtered and re-added correctly across server refreshes

## Goal proposal dismissed but reappears

- Proposals now use `propose_*` tool calls (e.g. `propose_goal`), which persist in message history as tool result blocks. Each completed proposal block includes an "Open proposal" button for re-access — proposals are no longer lost on reconnect or cache eviction.
- localStorage key: `bobbit-goal-proposal-dismissed-<sessionId>` stores djb2 hash of `title + "\n" + spec`
- Check: (1) key exists for session, (2) hash matches, (3) session is not goal-assistant type (those use IndexedDB)
- Cleanup: `clearDismissedProposal()` in `terminateSession()`
- Legacy XML proposal parsing (`proposal-parsers.ts`) still works as a deprecated fallback — check console for `[proposal] Detected legacy XML proposal block` warnings

## Render performance

- `renderApp()` debounced via `requestAnimationFrame` — multiple calls collapse
- For synchronous DOM updates, use `renderAppSync()`

## Background process pills (BgProcessPill / AgentInterface)

- **Dropdown renders via portal**: `BgProcessPill` appends its log dropdown to `document.body` instead of rendering it inline. This is necessary because the "More" overflow popover uses `backdrop-filter: blur()`, which creates a new CSS containing block — `position: fixed` children behave like `position: absolute` and `mask-image` clips them. If the dropdown appears mispositioned or clipped inside a popover, check that the portal is working (the `#bg-process-dropdown` element should be a direct child of `document.body`, not nested inside the pill or popover).
- **Dismiss for popover pills skips animation**: Pills inside the "More" popover lack the animation wrapper that visible pills have. `_handlePillDismiss` in `AgentInterface` detects hidden (popover) pills and calls `onBgProcessDismiss()` directly instead of waiting for a `pill-fade-out` animation. If dismiss stops working for popover pills, check that the hidden-set detection still matches the overflow logic in `_renderPillStrip()`.

## Gates

- State in `GateStore` (`.bobbit/state/gates.json`)
- Check dependencies via `GET /api/goals/:id/gates`
- **Verification output modal empty?** The modal has two data sources for step output:
  1. **API bootstrap** — on open, the modal (and its parent) reads accumulated output from `GET /api/goals/:id/verifications/active`. The chat widget (`GateVerificationLive`) seeds its `_stepOutputs` Map from the API in `_fetchAndReconcile()`, and falls back to `this.steps[index]?.output` in `_openModal()`. The dashboard reads `step.liveOutput || step.output`. The modal itself calls `_fetchBootstrapOutput()` as a one-time fetch when `initialOutput` is empty.
  2. **Live WS streaming** — the `/ws/viewer` WebSocket delivers `gate_verification_step_output` events in real-time. Events are dispatched as `gate-verification-event` CustomEvents on `document`; the `VerificationOutputModal` subscribes to these and appends chunks.
  
  If the modal shows "Waiting for output…": first check the API endpoint returns step output (`curl /api/goals/:id/verifications/active` — look for non-empty `output` in the steps array). If the API has output but the modal is empty, the parent component may not be passing it through — verify the fallback chain. If neither source has output, the verification command may not have produced any stdout/stderr yet. For live streaming issues, check that the `/ws/viewer` WS connection is active (browser DevTools → Network → WS tab). The connection opens on dashboard mount and closes on navigation away; it auto-reconnects after 3s on unexpected close.
- **Sandboxed verification commands**: For sandboxed goals, `command` verification steps run inside the project's container via `docker exec`. If command steps show unexpected results (e.g. missing files, stale code), check: (1) is the goal sandboxed (`goal.sandboxed`)? (2) is the project container still running (`docker ps --filter label=bobbit-project=<projectId>`)? If the container is unavailable, the harness falls back to host execution — which won't have the team's commits. Look for "no project container found" warnings in the verification output.
- **Session "view" links**: Verification step and delegate session links navigate in-place via `location.hash` (no new tab). If clicking "view" does nothing, check for JavaScript errors in the console — the click handler sets `location.hash = '#/session/<id>'`.

## Git diff viewer not showing diffs

1. Widget needs `sessionId` or `goalId` + `token`
2. Path sanitization rejects `..` and absolute paths
3. Git command has 5s timeout, 500KB response cap
4. Dropdown renders into portal (`document.body`) — not clipped by overflow
5. `_currentDiffFile` guard prevents stale responses

## Sandbox sessions

- `GET /api/sandbox-status` for Docker availability
- Worktree sessions now correctly call `applySandboxWiring()` via the pipeline (previously `_setupWorktreeAndLaunchAgent()` skipped sandbox wiring)
- `sessions.json` has `sandboxed: boolean`
- Container can't reach internet? Check: (1) `docker network inspect bobbit-sandbox-net` shows the network exists, (2) container is attached to it (`docker inspect <container>` → Networks), (3) host firewall isn't blocking Docker bridge traffic
- Container can't reach gateway? Check: (1) `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` is in the Docker args, (2) `BOBBIT_GATEWAY_URL` matches real address
- Auth failing? Check `BOBBIT_TOKEN` is scoped token from `SandboxTokenStore`
- Sessions not surviving restart? Session logs are bind-mounted from the host (`.bobbit/state/`), so they survive container death. Check `sessions.json` has the session entry and the `.jsonl` file exists on host disk.
- Delegates failing? Parent needs `sandboxed: true` + sandbox still configured in `project.yaml`

## Project container

- `docker ps --filter label=bobbit-project=<projectId>` to find the project's container
- Container not starting? Check `docker logs <containerId>` for init sequence errors (clone, npm ci, build)
- Container not reconnecting after restart? The gateway finds containers by label on startup — verify the label matches with `docker inspect <containerId>` → Labels
- Named volume lost (Docker Desktop reset)? The container will re-clone from remote and re-run npm ci on next init. Git commits are safe if push-to-remote hooks were active.
- Container worktrees missing after recreation? Verify the `bobbit-worktrees-<projectId>` volume exists (`docker volume ls`). This volume persists `/workspace-wt` across container recreation.

## Container death & recovery

When a sandbox container is killed or removed, sessions auto-recover. Use this checklist when recovery doesn't work as expected.

- **Health monitor not detecting death?** Check `[project-sandbox]` log lines. The monitor polls every 20s via `docker inspect`. If `_status` is `"starting"` (container never initialized), the monitor skips checks — verify `initForProject()` completed successfully.
- **Recovery failing repeatedly?** After a failed `init()`, the health monitor retries on the next poll cycle (every 20s). Check Docker daemon is running and the image exists (`docker images bobbit-agent`). Look for `[project-sandbox] Health check recovery failed` in logs.
- **Sessions stuck in `terminated`?** The `process_exit` → `terminated` transition is immediate, but auto-recovery depends on the health monitor detecting the container death and `SandboxManager` propagating the `container-recovered` event. Check: (1) `subscribeSandboxRecovery()` was called during startup (look for the wiring in `server.ts`), (2) `SandboxManager.onContainerRecovered` has listeners, (3) `recoverSandboxSessions()` is not throwing (check `[session-manager] Sandbox recovery failed` in logs).
- **Sessions archived instead of recovered?** The 3-tier worktree recovery failed: worktree doesn't exist on the volume, `git worktree repair` didn't help, and `createWorktree` from the persisted branch also failed. Check: (1) the session has a persisted `branch` value in `sessions.json`, (2) the branch exists on the remote (`git ls-remote origin <branch>`), (3) the named volume `bobbit-worktrees-<projectId>` survived the container death (`docker volume ls`).
- **WebSocket clients not seeing recovery?** `recoverSandboxSessions()` saves connected WebSocket clients before session deletion and re-attaches them after restore. If clients aren't getting the `session_status: idle` broadcast, check that `ws.readyState === 1` (OPEN) at re-attach time — long-dead containers may have caused the browser to close the connection.
- **Recovery timing**: Expect ~20-40s from container death to session recovery (one health check interval + container recreation + worktree verification + agent process spawn). The `process_exit` → `terminated` UI transition is immediate.
- **Key log prefixes**: `[project-sandbox]` for health monitor and container lifecycle, `[session-manager]` for session recovery and worktree repair, `[sandbox-manager]` for event propagation between subsystems.
- **Testing container recovery**: Kill the container with `docker rm -f <containerId>` and watch server logs. Sessions should transition: `idle` → `terminated` (process_exit) → `idle` (auto-recovery). Run recovery E2E tests: `npx playwright test --config playwright-e2e.config.ts --project=api sandbox-recovery`.

## Search index

- Each project has its own `<project-root>/.bobbit/state/search.db` — delete and restart to rebuild
- `ProjectContextManager.searchAll()` aggregates results across all project indexes
- Schema version is 3 (added `project_id` column for multi-project filtering). Version mismatch triggers automatic rebuild on next server start
- Check `better-sqlite3` loaded correctly (native addon)
- FTS5 on 10K docs < 10ms — slow search means network/serialization bottleneck
- Purged sessions still showing? Check `purgeOneSession()` calls index cleanup
- Staff not appearing in search? `StaffManager` uses per-project `searchIndex` from `ProjectContextManager` — verify the correct project context's search index is being used. `rebuildFromStores()` passes `staff.projectId` for correct project filtering
- Sidebar filter not working? The sidebar uses client-side filtering only (no API calls). It matches goal titles, session titles, session agent roles, and staff names. Check `_applySearchFilter()` in `Sidebar.ts`
- Full search page (`#/search`) is the sole consumer of the FTS API — it manages its own state, independent from sidebar filtering
- Archived section not auto-opening on search match? Check `_archivedBySearch` flag — it distinguishes search-triggered expansion from manual clicks

## Paginated archives

- Cursor based on `archivedAt` timestamp
- Missing items? Check `archivedAt` is set (older items may lack it)
- Count mismatch? Verify total from paginated response metadata

## Slash skill expansion

- Skills show in autocomplete but don't expand? The autocomplete API (`/api/slash-skills`) must receive the session's `projectId` so it resolves skills from the correct project's `config_directories`. Verify `AgentInterface.projectId` is set from session data in `session-manager.ts`
- Check server logs for `[ws-handler] Slash skill "<name>" not found for session <id> (cwd=<cwd>)` — this warning fires when a `/skill-name` pattern matches but `getSlashSkill()` returns undefined, indicating a project context mismatch or missing skill file
- In multi-project setups, each project's `config_directories` controls which skills are discovered. A skill defined in project B's config directory won't appear for sessions in project A

## Multi-project / per-project state

- State is per-project: goals, sessions, tasks, teams, gates, search, costs all live in `<project-root>/.bobbit/state/`
- `ProjectContextManager` manages all `ProjectContext` instances and routes store access
- Project registry at `<server-cwd>/.bobbit/state/projects.json` — check file exists and is valid JSON
- Server CWD auto-registered as default project via `ensureDefaultProject()` on startup
- `GET /api/projects` to list all registered projects
- Sessions/goals not appearing? Check `projectId` field matches the expected project. Verify the correct project's `sessions.json` / `goals.json` contains the record
- Sidebar not grouping? Project folder rows are always shown — check that `state.projects` is populated and `renderProjectHeader()` is being called
- Project registration failing? `rootPath` must be absolute and exist on disk; duplicate paths are rejected
- Search not filtering by project? Verify `?projectId=` query param is passed; each project has its own `search.db`
- Config not cascading? Check all three `.bobbit/config/` directories (global, server, project) and verify `resolveScalarConfig()` / `resolveEntities()` return expected scope
- **State migration**: On first startup after upgrade, central state is distributed to per-project dirs. Check for `.bobbit/state/.migrated-to-per-project` marker. Central files renamed with `.pre-migration` suffix (not deleted). If migration didn't run, check that projects are registered before migration runs
- **Store routing bugs**: All store access must go through `ProjectContextManager` — direct `this.store` calls bypass per-project routing. `SessionManager` uses `resolveStoreForSession()` / `resolveStoreForId()` to find the correct per-project `SessionStore`
- **Known limitations**: Cost tracking uses the default project's `CostTracker`. `active-verifications.json` stays in central state dir

## Gate re-signal cancellation

- `cancelStaleVerifications()` in `verification-harness.ts` terminates old reviewer sessions and persists `status: "failed"` to the gate store
- Cancelled flag checked after `Promise.all` to suppress stale results
- Check `sessionManager` and `teamManager` passed to `VerificationHarness`
- Inspect: `GET /api/goals/:goalId/verifications/active`
- **Stuck verification?** Cancel manually via `POST /api/goals/:goalId/gates/:gateId/cancel-verification` (returns `{ cancelled: true }` or `{ cancelled: false }` if nothing was running). The goal dashboard also shows a Cancel button when a verification is in "running" state.
- **Zombie detection**: On re-signal, the server checks `areVerificationSessionsAlive()` before returning 409. If all reviewer sessions are dead, the stale verification is auto-cancelled and the new signal proceeds. Command steps (no `sessionId`) and waiting steps are treated as alive.

## Phased verification

- Steps are grouped by `phase` (integer, default 0) and phases execute sequentially
- Within each phase, steps run in parallel
- If any step in a phase fails, remaining phases are skipped (status: `"skipped"`)
- Skipped steps carry `skipped: true` on `GateSignalStep`, persisted in `gates.json` — this lets the UI show the correct dash icon after reload (without it, skipped steps would appear as passed or failed based on the `passed` field alone)
- `gate_verification_phase_started` WebSocket event fires before each phase
- Step events include `phase` field; skipped steps show `"Skipped — earlier phase failed"`
- Check `ActiveVerification.currentPhase` via `GET /api/goals/:goalId/verifications/active`
- If LLM reviews run when they shouldn't: verify `phase: 1` is set on `llm-review` steps in the workflow YAML

## Verification artifacts

- `llm-review` steps store full output as `text/markdown` artifacts on `GateSignalStep.artifact`
- Artifacts are capped at 10 MB; content truncated if exceeded
- Dashboard shows markdown artifacts in collapsible "Full Review" sections; HTML artifacts via "View Report" button
- If artifacts are missing: check that the `llm-review` step completed (not skipped/cancelled)
- Artifact data persists in `gates.json` alongside step results
