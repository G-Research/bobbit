# Bobbit — Debugging Guide

Scannable checklists for common issues. Each entry: symptom → where to look → key detail.

## Streaming performance (UI sluggishness)

- **Architecture**: `StreamingMessageContainer` owns rendering during streaming via `setMessage()` with `requestAnimationFrame` batching. `AgentInterface` must NOT call `this.requestUpdate()` in the `message_update` event handler — only the streaming container updates on each token.
- **If the UI feels sluggish during streaming**: check `AgentInterface.setupSessionSubscription()` — the `message_update` case should only update the streaming container, not trigger a full `AgentInterface` re-render.
- **Markdown content throttle**: `AssistantMessage._getThrottledContent()` limits `<markdown-block>` `.content` updates to ~4x/sec (250ms) during streaming. This prevents `MarkdownBlock.render()` — which runs `marked.parse()` on the full text, reconfigures parser extensions, and does regex-heavy HTML escaping — from executing on every rAF frame. Without this throttle, HTML-heavy streaming responses cause main-thread jank because each `marked.parse()` call grows more expensive as content accumulates. The throttle uses the same pattern as `WriteRenderer._getThrottledCode()`: snapshot the content on first call, start a 250ms cooldown timer, and return the snapshot until the timer expires. A 20-character prefix check detects message identity changes (e.g. the element is reused for a different message) and resets the throttle immediately. When `isStreaming` flips to false, the timer is cleared in `render()` so the final content is always rendered accurately.
- **Text appears laggy or stale during streaming?** The 250ms throttle means visible text trails the actual streamed content by up to 250ms — this is intentional and barely perceptible. If text appears significantly more stale than that, check: (1) `_contentThrottleTimer` is being cleared when `isStreaming` becomes false, (2) the prefix-based identity reset in `_getThrottledContent()` is firing correctly when switching between messages, (3) no additional throttle or debounce has been added upstream in `StreamingMessageContainer`.
- **toolResultsById memoization**: `AgentInterface._getToolResultsById()` caches the tool-results Map to avoid creating a new reference on every render, which would cause `MessageList` to re-render unnecessarily.
- **content-visibility CSS**: `message-list > .flex > *` uses `content-visibility: auto` to skip layout/paint for off-screen messages in long conversations.
- State-transition events (`message_start`, `message_end`, `agent_start`, `agent_end`, `turn_start`, `turn_end`) still call `requestUpdate()` — only `message_update` (the hot path) is excluded.

## Large file writes (agent writes >32KB)

- **System unresponsive during large writes?** The truncation system in `truncateLargeToolContent()` should be stripping content >32KB from WebSocket broadcasts and EventBuffer. Check that `subscribeToEvents()` in `session-setup.ts` applies truncation before `broadcast()` and `eventBuffer.push()`.
- **Full content not loading in UI?** The "Load full content" button in `WriteRenderer` fetches via `GET /api/sessions/:id/tool-content/:messageIndex/:blockIndex`. Check: (1) the endpoint is registered in `server.ts`, (2) the session's `.jsonl` file exists and contains the full message, (3) `messageIndex` and `blockIndex` resolve to the correct content block.
- **Truncation happening for small files?** Threshold is `LARGE_CONTENT_THRESHOLD` (32KB) in `truncate-large-content.ts`. Only string content in `toolCall`/`arguments` or `tool_use`/`input` blocks is checked.
- **Search indexing memory spike?** `extractTextFromMessage()` should also handle truncated content gracefully — it receives the original event via `handleAgentLifecycle()`, not the truncated one. If indexing large content causes issues, the search extraction path may need its own truncation.
- See [docs/internals.md — Large content truncation](internals.md#large-content-truncation) for the full architecture.

## Duplicate messages

- Check `flushDeferredMessage()` and `_deferredAssistantMessage` in `remote-agent.ts`
- `MessageList` renders `state.messages` (completed); `StreamingMessageContainer` renders `state.streamMessage` (in-progress) — they must never overlap
- Tool-call messages stay in streaming until the next message starts

## Streaming dedup / reorder

- **Symptoms**: during live streaming (not reload-replay), assistant or toolResult messages appear twice, or parallel tool results appear in the wrong order. Most often observed right after a mid-turn WS reconnect (dev-server restart, tab sleep/resume, flaky network) or during rapid parallel tool-call bursts.
- **Root cause in one line**: transport-level snapshot-vs-live race. See [docs/internals.md — Event stream ordering & dedup](internals.md#event-stream-ordering--dedup) for the architecture and [docs/design/streaming-dedup-reorder.md](design/streaming-dedup-reorder.md) for the full reasoning.
- **On the wire**: every `{type:"event"}` frame must carry a numeric `seq` and `ts`. Inspect frames in DevTools → Network → WS. If `seq` is missing, the server is pre-fix or the frame didn’t go through `emitSessionEvent()` in `src/server/agent/session-manager.ts` — check for any stray `eventBuffer.push()` + `broadcast()` pair that bypasses the helper.
- **Client state**: `RemoteAgent._highestSeq` should advance monotonically; `_pendingEvents` should stay empty except during a brief out-of-order window. A persistently non-empty `_pendingEvents` means frames are arriving with a gap the server never closes — usually the `resume`/`resume_gap` handshake is broken.
- **Reconnect path**: on WS reopen the client sends `{type:"resume", fromSeq: _highestSeq}` before any other traffic. Server replays via `EventBuffer.since(fromSeq)`. If the seq has been evicted from the 1000-entry ring, server returns `resume_gap` and client falls back to the `get_messages` snapshot path. Check `EventBuffer.size` and `lastSeq` against the client’s `fromSeq` when diagnosing a suspected eviction.
- **Repro test**: `ST-DEDUP-01` in `tests/e2e/ui/stories-streaming.spec.ts`. It drops the WS mid-burst, reconnects, and asserts the final `messages[]` has no duplicates and preserves order. Must fail on pre-fix master; must pass after the fix. `RE-07` in `tests/e2e/ui/stories-resilience.spec.ts` also exercises the same reconnect path and should stay green.
- **Unit coverage**: `tests/event-buffer.test.ts` (seq/eviction/`since`/`canResumeFrom`/`lastSeq`) and `tests/remote-agent-seq-dedup.spec.ts` (dedup, ordering, resume, compat fallback).

## Session connection issues

- Session creation logic lives in `session-setup.ts` (pipeline steps + executors) and `session-manager.ts` (thin wrappers)
- `executePlan()` runs the full pipeline synchronously for normal/delegate sessions
- `executeWorktreeAsync()` runs asynchronously for worktree sessions (fire-and-forget, returns immediately with `status: "preparing"`)
- `handleSetupFailure()` in `session-setup.ts` handles cleanup on pipeline errors
- `subscribeToEvents()` is the shared event subscription function across all session types
- `connectToSession()` in `session-manager.ts` creates ChatPanel before `remote.connect()`
- Model + WebSocket connect run in parallel via `Promise.all`
- `switchGeneration` / `isStale()` invalidates in-flight work on rapid switches
- On connect failure, `state.chatPanel` is cleared (prevents stuck spinner)
- `model` and `thinkingLevel` synced from server's `get_state` response on connect/reconnect

## Session/goal refresh not updating

- Both stores track a `generation` counter; clients pass `?since=N` to skip unchanged data
- Check `sessionsGeneration` and `goalsGeneration` in `state.ts`
- Server returns `{ changed: false }` when generation matches

## Gate status stale

- `state.gateStatusCache` refreshed via: (1) `refreshGateStatusCache()` on initial load, (2) `refreshGateStatusForGoal()` on WS events `gate_status_changed` / `gate_verification_complete`
- Dashboard gate polling also syncs to this cache

## Context bar / model state

After a server restart, the context bar may show wrong info (e.g. 200k instead of 1M) or nothing at all. This happens because the agent process's `getState()` RPC may fail or return incomplete data before the process is fully ready.

- **Server-side fallback**: `sendFallbackModelState()` in `handler.ts` reads persisted `modelProvider`/`modelId` from the session store and calls `inferMeta()` to attach the correct `contextWindow`. This runs when `getState()` fails, is skipped (dormant/preparing sessions), or returns data without model metadata.
- **Client-side retry**: `remote-agent.ts` retries `get_state` after 3s on reconnect if `contextWindow` is still 0.
- **Default contextWindow is 0**: Before the server provides real data, `contextWindow` starts at 0 (not 200k), so the context bar shows nothing rather than a misleading value.
- If context bar still shows wrong info after restart, check that `modelProvider` and `modelId` are persisted in `<project-root>/.bobbit/state/sessions.json` for the affected session.
- `SessionManager.getPersistedSession(id)` exposes persisted session data used by the fallback mechanism.

## Session persistence

- Check `<project-root>/.bobbit/state/sessions.json` (per-project, not centralized)
- Initial persist happens via `persistOnce()` in `session-setup.ts` — a single `store.put()` with all structural fields at creation time
- `persistSessionMetadata()` only calls `store.update()` (never `store.put()`) — updates `agentSessionFile` once the agent reports it
- `persistSessionMetadata()` retries 3 times with backoff (500ms, 1s, 2s) on failure
- `sandboxed` is a typed field on `SessionInfo` (no `(session as any)._sandboxed` hack)
- `restoreSessions()` in `session-manager.ts` skips sessions with missing `.jsonl` files
- Failed restores create dormant entries that revive on client connect
- **Server restarts are safe** — restarting the gateway never deletes worktrees, terminates sessions, or purges archives. All agent work survives intact. Orphaned resources can be cleaned up manually via Settings → Maintenance tab or the `/api/maintenance/*` REST endpoints.

## Abort, steer & queue

- **Session status values**: `idle`, `streaming`, `preparing`, `dormant`, `terminated`, and `aborting`. The `aborting` status is broadcast immediately when the user clicks Stop — it covers the up-to-3s grace period before a force-kill. UI shows an "Aborting..." spinner during this state.
- **Steered messages lost after abort?** Steered messages are deferred — they stay in the queue until `drainQueue()` runs after the agent becomes idle. If steers appear lost after a force-kill, check that `resetDispatched()` was called before `drainQueue()` in the restart path. Without it, messages marked `dispatched` from a pre-kill drain attempt won't be retried.
- **Direct live-steer (WS `{type:"steer"}`) lost when user clicks Stop?** This is the PI-25b path and is distinct from the `steer_queued` promotion path PI-25 covers. `SessionManager.deliverLiveSteer()` must persist the text into `promptQueue` as `{ isSteered: true, dispatched: true }` **before** forwarding to `rpcClient.steer()` — otherwise the SDK-parked copy is silently discarded by `forceAbort`. Happy-path cleanup runs via the `message_end(user)` → `removeDispatched()` hook in `handleAgentLifecycle`; abort cleanup runs via `forceAbort` + the `agent_end`-when-aborting branch, both of which call `resetDispatched()` + `drainQueue()` to re-arm non-flushed rows. At-least-once delivery is accepted in the force-kill race window. See AGENTS.md → Debugging and user stories PI-25b / PI-25c (`tests/e2e/abort-status-e2e.spec.ts`).
- **Steered messages arriving one-at-a-time instead of batched?** `drainQueue()` batches all consecutive steered messages at the front of the queue via `dequeueAllSteered()`. If they arrive separately, check that the messages are all marked `steered: true` and are contiguous at the front of the queue (non-steered messages in between will break the batch).
- **Draft lost on rapid session switch?** The client awaits any in-flight `_pendingSave` promise before loading the draft for the new session. If drafts are still lost, check that `_flushDraft()` is returning its save promise and that `_setupPromptDraftHandlers()` awaits it.
- **Draft not restoring after session switch?** Draft restore uses a `requestAnimationFrame` retry loop (up to 5 frames) to survive Lit re-renders that reset the editor value. If the draft still doesn't appear, check that the rAF `reapply` callback is firing (add a `console.log` inside it) and that `_draftSessionId` hasn't been nulled by a concurrent session switch.
- **`bash_bg wait` not returning after a steer?** A steer (user-initiated or `team_steer`) should abort any in-flight `bash_bg wait` within ~100ms so the agent isn't stuck inside a tool call. The bg process itself is **not** killed — only the wait call resolves with `{ aborted: true }`, and the shell extension emits `Process <hdr> wait interrupted by steer. Use 'logs' or 'wait' again to continue monitoring.`. If waits are still blocking: (1) verify the live-steer caller routes through `SessionManager.deliverLiveSteer()` — this is what invokes `bgProcessManager.abortAllWaits(sessionId)` before forwarding to `rpcClient.steer()`. Call sites: `ws/handler.ts` `case "steer"`, `team-manager.ts` `injectSteerMessage`/task-completion nudge, and `SessionManager.drainQueue()`'s steered-batch branch. (2) Check the wait registry on `BgProcessManager` — `registerWait(sessionId, controller)` is called by the `/bg-processes/:pid/wait` REST handler and `unregisterWait` in its `finally`; `abortAllWaits(sessionId)` iterates the set. (3) `terminateSession` also calls `abortAllWaits()` before `cleanup()` so a terminating session never leaks a hung wait HTTP handler. Unit tests in `tests/bg-process-manager.test.ts`; E2E round-trip in `tests/e2e/bg-wait-steer-abort.spec.ts`.
- See [prompt-queue.md](prompt-queue.md) for the full queue architecture and [prompt-queue.md — Abort and force-kill recovery](prompt-queue.md#abort-and-force-kill-recovery) for the force-kill flow.

## Compaction

- Check `_isCompacting`, `_compactionSyntheticMessages`, `_usageStaleAfterCompaction` in `remote-agent.ts`
- `compacting_placeholder` must be filtered and re-added correctly across server refreshes

## Goal proposal dismissed but reappears

- Proposals now use `propose_*` tool calls (e.g. `propose_goal`), which persist in message history as tool result blocks. Each completed proposal block includes an "Open proposal" button for re-access — proposals are no longer lost on reconnect or cache eviction.
- localStorage key: `bobbit-goal-proposal-dismissed-<sessionId>` stores djb2 hash of `title + "\n" + spec`
- Check: (1) key exists for session, (2) hash matches, (3) session is not goal-assistant type (those use IndexedDB)
- Cleanup: `clearDismissedProposal()` in `terminateSession()`
- Legacy XML proposal parsing (`proposal-parsers.ts`) still works as a deprecated fallback — check console for `[proposal] Detected legacy XML proposal block` warnings

## Render performance

- `renderApp()` debounced via `requestAnimationFrame` — multiple calls collapse
- For synchronous DOM updates, use `renderAppSync()`

## Background process pills (BgProcessPill / AgentInterface)

- **Dropdown renders via portal**: `BgProcessPill` appends its log dropdown to `document.body` instead of rendering it inline. This is necessary because the "More" overflow popover uses `backdrop-filter: blur()`, which creates a new CSS containing block — `position: fixed` children behave like `position: absolute` and `mask-image` clips them. If the dropdown appears mispositioned or clipped inside a popover, check that the portal is working (the `#bg-process-dropdown` element should be a direct child of `document.body`, not nested inside the pill or popover).
- **Dismiss for popover pills skips animation**: Pills inside the "More" popover lack the animation wrapper that visible pills have. `_handlePillDismiss` in `AgentInterface` detects hidden (popover) pills and calls `onBgProcessDismiss()` directly instead of waiting for a `pill-fade-out` animation. If dismiss stops working for popover pills, check that the hidden-set detection still matches the overflow logic in `_renderPillStrip()`.

## Gates

- State in `GateStore` (`.bobbit/state/gates.json`)
- Check dependencies via `GET /api/goals/:id/gates`
- **Reviewer flags "branch doesn't match design" on a pre-implementation gate?** That is the classic stale-baseline false positive. Pre-implementation gates (`content: true` with no `depends_on` — e.g. design-doc, issue-analysis) are classified by `isPreImplementationGate()` in `src/server/agent/verification-logic.ts` and the harness must strip all `git diff` / `git log` instructions from the review prompt for them. If a reviewer is still citing branch diffs, check that (1) the role YAML's preamble contains the `{{REVIEW_CONTEXT}}` placeholder (reviewer, architect, spec-auditor), (2) `buildReviewPrompt()` in `src/server/agent/verification-harness.ts` is substituting the pre-impl notice, and (3) no user-override role YAML has re-introduced hardcoded diff commands. Implementation-gate reviewers diff against `origin/<primary>...HEAD` — never local `<primary>`, which can be stale. Full convention: [docs/goals-workflows-tasks.md — Gate verification baselines](goals-workflows-tasks.md#gate-verification-baselines).
- **Verification output modal empty?** The modal has two data sources for step output:
  1. **API bootstrap** — on open, the modal (and its parent) reads accumulated output from `GET /api/goals/:id/verifications/active`. The chat widget (`GateVerificationLive`) seeds its `_stepOutputs` Map from the API in `_fetchAndReconcile()`, and falls back to `this.steps[index]?.output` in `_openModal()`. The dashboard reads `step.liveOutput || step.output`. The modal itself calls `_fetchBootstrapOutput()` as a one-time fetch when `initialOutput` is empty.
  2. **Live WS streaming** — the `/ws/viewer` WebSocket delivers `gate_verification_step_output` events in real-time. Events are dispatched as `gate-verification-event` CustomEvents on `document`; the `VerificationOutputModal` subscribes to these and appends chunks.
  
  If the modal shows "Waiting for output…": first check the API endpoint returns step output (`curl /api/goals/:id/verifications/active` — look for non-empty `output` in the steps array). If the API has output but the modal is empty, the parent component may not be passing it through — verify the fallback chain. If neither source has output, the verification command may not have produced any stdout/stderr yet. For live streaming issues, check that the `/ws/viewer` WS connection is active (browser DevTools → Network → WS tab). The connection opens on dashboard mount and closes on navigation away; it auto-reconnects after 3s on unexpected close.
- **Verify-step runs wrong project's commands** (e.g. `npm run check` on a .NET goal, or bobbit's defaults for a ReqLess goal): `{{project.*}}` variables in command-type steps, LLM-review retry prompts, agent-QA retry prompts, and the QA timeout lookup are all substituted from the goal's owning project's `ProjectConfigStore`, resolved via `resolveProjectConfigStore(goalId)` in `src/server/agent/verification-harness.ts`. If a step runs with the wrong project's commands, (1) confirm the harness was constructed with `projectContextManager` (non-test wiring always passes it), (2) look for `[verification] Goal "<id>" not found in any project context` warnings in the server log — that means PCM has no context for the goal and the harness fell back to the server-level singleton. (3) Any new read of `{{project.*}}` inside the harness must go through the helper, not `this.projectConfigStore` directly.
- **Sandboxed verification commands**: For sandboxed goals, `command` verification steps run inside the project's container via `docker exec`. If command steps show unexpected results (e.g. missing files, stale code), check: (1) is the goal sandboxed (`goal.sandboxed`)? (2) is the project container still running (`docker ps --filter label=bobbit-project=<projectId>`)? If the container is unavailable, the harness falls back to host execution — which won't have the team's commits. Look for "no project container found" warnings in the verification output.
- **Session "view" links**: Verification step and delegate session links navigate in-place via `location.hash` (no new tab). If clicking "view" does nothing, check for JavaScript errors in the console — the click handler sets `location.hash = '#/session/<id>'`.

## Git diff viewer not showing diffs

1. Widget needs `sessionId` or `goalId` + `token`
2. Path sanitization rejects `..` and absolute paths
3. Git command has 5s timeout, 500KB response cap
4. Dropdown renders into portal (`document.body`) — not clipped by overflow
5. `_currentDiffFile` guard prevents stale responses

## Git status widget disappears / stays loading

Widget hides **only** when the server explicitly confirms "not a git repository". Every other failure (500, timeout, abort, network error) must leave the widget visible in either a skeleton or last-known-good state. Architecture in [docs/internals.md — Git status cache & client resilience](internals.md#git-status-cache--client-resilience); full design in [docs/design/git-status-widget-reliability.md](design/git-status-widget-reliability.md).

- **Widget gone entirely after a transient fetch failure?** Check `gitRepoKnown` on the `AgentInterface` (session) or the module-level `gitRepoKnown` in `goal-dashboard.ts`. It is `'yes' | 'no' | 'unknown'` and defaults to `'unknown'` on session connect / dashboard load. Only an HTTP 400 with body `{ error: "Not a git repository" }` flips it to `'no'`. The render gate is `gitRepoKnown !== 'no'` — if the widget is missing while `'unknown'` or `'yes'`, the gate has been short-circuited somewhere.
- **Stuck in "Checking git…" skeleton?** The skeleton renders while `loading && !branch`. Retry lives in `refreshGitStatusForSession` (`src/app/session-manager.ts`): 4 attempts at [0, 500, 2000, 5000]ms. `gitStatusLoading` stays `true` across **all** retries and is cleared only in the final `finally`. If loading never clears, something is resolving attempt 4 without hitting that finally (check console for "git-status refresh failed after retries").
- **Retries not firing / only one attempt visible in network tab?** The retry loop aborts if `activeSessionId() !== sessionId`. Rapid session switches tear down the previous controller — this is correct. Also verify the `GitStatusResult` coming out of `fetchGitStatus`: only `kind: 'error'` retries; `kind: 'not-a-repo'` short-circuits to `'no'`.
- **30s safety poll never ticks?** Gated on all of: `document.visibilityState === 'visible'`, `activeSessionId() === sessionId`, `gitRepoKnown !== 'no'`. A 10s coalesce window via `gitStatusLastRefreshAt` skips the tick if an event-driven refresh fired recently — this is intentional. On `visibilitychange → visible` an immediate refresh fires without waiting for the next 30s boundary.
- **Server returning same stale value for rapid-fire requests?** `batchGitStatus` in `src/server/server.ts` is a 750ms-TTL single-flight cache keyed by `${containerId ?? 'host'}::${cwd}::${summary|untracked}`. Concurrent callers share the same in-flight promise; resolved entries are reused for up to 750ms. Errors are **not** cached (the entry is deleted on rejection). Bust keys manually via the exported `invalidateGitStatusCache(cwd, containerId?)` — called automatically on `/git-commit`, `/git-pull`, `/git-push`, merge, and `?fetch=true`.
- **Dropdown opens but untracked files never appear?** The default `/git-status` call uses `git status --porcelain=v1 -uno` for speed (summary path). `GitStatusWidget._toggle` fires a `git-status-dropdown-open` CustomEvent (bubbles, composed); `AgentInterface` listens and refetches with `?untracked=1` (full path, `-uall`). Check that the listener is wired (`session-manager.ts` attaches it on connect) and that the response carries `untrackedIncluded: true`. Summary vs untracked are separate cache keys, so both responses coexist.
- **`partial: true` on every response?** Phase A (fast metadata: branch, ahead/behind, upstream) has a short budget; Phase B (porcelain) is 15s. If porcelain consistently times out, the repo is huge or something is holding a git lock. The client renders a yellow warning dot and the dropdown offers "Re-scan" which triggers `?untracked=1`.
- **Handler-level retry loop firing on every request?** The handler wraps `batchGitStatus` in a single retry on uncaught error — this is **belt-and-braces** on top of the spawn-level retry inside `runBatchGitStatus` (which handles transient EAGAIN / ENOBUFS / EBUSY / EMFILE / ENFILE / ETIMEDOUT / SIGTERM / SIGKILL / transient ENOENT on win32). Errors never enter the cache, so retried calls don't serve stale failures. If you see the handler retry path hit constantly, look for a genuine git or Docker problem — don't just widen the retry predicate.
- **Test-only spawn hook**: `__setGitStatusFake(fn)` / `__clearGitStatusFake()` replace `runBatchGitStatus`'s git-spawn path with a deterministic function, and `__getGitStatusInvocationCount()` / `__resetGitStatusInvocationCount()` expose the real-invocation counter used by coalesce tests. These exist because under CI load the real `git status` spawn becomes flaky (EAGAIN / ENFILE / Windows ENOENT races) and makes retry / coalesce assertions non-deterministic. Production code never touches them.

## Sandbox sessions

- `GET /api/sandbox-status` for Docker availability
- Worktree sessions now correctly call `applySandboxWiring()` via the pipeline (previously `_setupWorktreeAndLaunchAgent()` skipped sandbox wiring)
- `sessions.json` has `sandboxed: boolean`
- Container can't reach internet? Check: (1) `docker network inspect bobbit-sandbox-net` shows the network exists, (2) container is attached to it (`docker inspect <container>` → Networks), (3) host firewall isn't blocking Docker bridge traffic
- Container can't reach gateway? Check: (1) `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` is in the Docker args, (2) `BOBBIT_GATEWAY_URL` matches real address
- Auth failing? Check `BOBBIT_TOKEN` is scoped token from `SandboxTokenStore`
- Sessions not surviving restart? Session logs are bind-mounted from the host (`.bobbit/state/`), so they survive container death. Check `sessions.json` has the session entry and the `.jsonl` file exists on host disk.
- Delegates failing? Parent needs `sandboxed: true` + sandbox still configured in `project.yaml`

## Project container

- `docker ps --filter label=bobbit-project=<projectId>` to find the project's container
- Container not starting? Check `docker logs <containerId>` for init sequence errors (clone, npm ci, build)
- Container not reconnecting after restart? The gateway finds containers by label on startup — verify the label matches with `docker inspect <containerId>` → Labels
- Named volume lost (Docker Desktop reset)? The container will re-clone from remote and re-run npm ci on next init. Git commits are safe if push-to-remote hooks were active.
- Container worktrees missing after recreation? Verify the `bobbit-worktrees-<projectId>` volume exists (`docker volume ls`). This volume persists `/workspace-wt` across container recreation.

## Container death & recovery

When a sandbox container is killed or removed, sessions auto-recover. Use this checklist when recovery doesn't work as expected.

- **Health monitor not detecting death?** Check `[project-sandbox]` log lines. The monitor polls every 20s via `docker inspect`. If `_status` is `"starting"` (container never initialized), the monitor skips checks — verify `initForProject()` completed successfully.
- **Recovery failing repeatedly?** After a failed `init()`, the health monitor retries on the next poll cycle (every 20s). Check Docker daemon is running and the image exists (`docker images bobbit-agent`). Look for `[project-sandbox] Health check recovery failed` in logs.
- **Sessions stuck in `terminated`?** The `process_exit` → `terminated` transition is immediate, but auto-recovery depends on the health monitor detecting the container death and `SandboxManager` propagating the `container-recovered` event. Check: (1) `subscribeSandboxRecovery()` was called during startup (look for the wiring in `server.ts`), (2) `SandboxManager.onContainerRecovered` has listeners, (3) `recoverSandboxSessions()` is not throwing (check `[session-manager] Sandbox recovery failed` in logs).
- **Sessions archived instead of recovered?** The 3-tier worktree recovery failed: worktree doesn't exist on the volume, `git worktree repair` didn't help, and `createWorktree` from the persisted branch also failed. Check: (1) the session has a persisted `branch` value in `sessions.json`, (2) the branch exists on the remote (`git ls-remote origin <branch>`), (3) the named volume `bobbit-worktrees-<projectId>` survived the container death (`docker volume ls`).
- **WebSocket clients not seeing recovery?** `recoverSandboxSessions()` saves connected WebSocket clients before session deletion and re-attaches them after restore. If clients aren't getting the `session_status: idle` broadcast, check that `ws.readyState === 1` (OPEN) at re-attach time — long-dead containers may have caused the browser to close the connection.
- **Recovery timing**: Expect ~20-40s from container death to session recovery (one health check interval + container recreation + worktree verification + agent process spawn). The `process_exit` → `terminated` UI transition is immediate.
- **Key log prefixes**: `[project-sandbox]` for health monitor and container lifecycle, `[session-manager]` for session recovery and worktree repair, `[sandbox-manager]` for event propagation between subsystems.
- **Testing container recovery**: Kill the container with `docker rm -f <containerId>` and watch server logs. Sessions should transition: `idle` → `terminated` (process_exit) → `idle` (auto-recovery). Run recovery E2E tests: `npx playwright test --config playwright-e2e.config.ts --project=api sandbox-recovery`.

## Search index

FlexSearch-backed lexical search (pure-JS, BM25-style ranking). Index per project at `<project-root>/.bobbit/state/search.flex/` (`index/*.json` + `meta.json`). No native binaries, no model downloads, no runtime network. See [docs/internals.md — Semantic search](internals.md#semantic-search) and [docs/design/portable-search.md](design/portable-search.md) for the full design.

- Force a full rebuild: delete `<project-root>/.bobbit/state/search.flex/` and restart, or `POST /api/search/rebuild?projectId=<id>`. Status dot goes yellow during rebuild.
- Meta mismatch auto-rebuilds: `engine`, `engineVersion`, `schemaVersion`, or `contentPolicyVersion` bumps in `meta.json` → server rebuilds on next open. Log line at info level on startup.
- Legacy `search.lance/` directories from the previous Nomic+LanceDB backend are deleted automatically on first open. The shared model cache at `~/.bobbit/models/` is unused by the current engine — safe to `rm -rf` to reclaim disk. Bobbit does not delete it automatically.
- `ProjectContextManager.searchAll()` aggregates results across all project indexes.
- Purged sessions still showing? `purgeOneSession()` must call `SearchService.removeMessagesForSession` + `removeSession`. Alternatively run the orphaned-index-rows maintenance scan (Settings → Maintenance → Search Index) to clean up rows whose parent entity is gone.
- **Search result click does nothing / ghost results appearing?** `ProjectContextManager.searchAll()` post-filters hits whose project/goal/session/staff no longer exists and fires opportunistic index cleanup; if stale rows persist, check that (1) `projectRegistry`/`sessionManager` were injected into `ProjectContextManager` at boot (see `server.ts`), (2) `matchedOn` is being set by `toSearchResult()` in `flex-store.ts` — `message` rows with `matchedOn === "metadata"` are dropped as phantom matches, (3) client-side stale-click races dispatch the `search-result-stale` window event (from `connectToSession({ onMissing: "toast" })`, `goal-dashboard.ts`, `staff-page.ts`) rather than the blocking `showConnectionError` modal — missing toast means the origin-tag flag wasn't passed. See [docs/internals.md — Orphan filtering & stale-click safety net](internals.md#orphan-filtering--stale-click-safety-net) and [docs/internals.md — Grouped search results & stale-click toast](internals.md#grouped-search-results--stale-click-toast).

### Search unavailable (red dot)

One failure path: the FlexSearch store failed to open (usually because `<project-root>/.bobbit/state/search.flex/` is unwritable or the on-disk index files are corrupt beyond partial-load recovery). Surfaces as the **red status dot** + "Search unavailable"; `/api/search` returns **503** with `{ error: "search-unavailable", reason, state }`. The Settings → Maintenance → Search Index panel exposes **Rebuild Index**, which clears the index and rebuilds from the source stores.

Corrupt per-key files are tolerated on open — the loader logs a warning, skips the bad file, and the meta check triggers a background rebuild. Crash-mid-flush leaves `.tmp` files that are ignored on next open.

### Stats endpoint didn't return

- `GET /api/search/stats?projectId=<id>` returns `{ state, engine, engineVersion, rowCountsBySource, datasetBytes, lastRebuildAt }`. **400** if `projectId` is missing; **503** if the service is disabled (body carries `reason`).
- Stuck in `state: "rebuilding"`? Check WS `index:progress` events are arriving; the service debounces to 500ms. A stalled rebuild usually means the indexer queue is starved — check server logs for `[search]` lines.
- Row counts all zero after a rebuild? The rebuild ran against an empty store set — verify `ProjectContext` has the expected `goalStore`/`sessionStore`/`staffStore` wired and that sessions have their `.jsonl` message files on disk (the message source streams from them).

### Performance

- FlexSearch builds posting lists at upsert time; there is no separate "build ANN index" phase.
- Slow search? Check `GET /api/search/stats` for row counts per source and `datasetBytes`. Expected p95 < 100ms for typical Bobbit corpora (< 100K rows). If the in-memory index has grown very large, trigger a rebuild — orphaned rows accumulated from deletes can inflate posting lists.
- Staff not appearing in search? Staff are indexed via a dedicated hook — `StaffManager` calls `searchIndex.indexStaff(staff)` (on `SearchService`) whenever a staff record is created or updated. `SearchService.indexStaff` builds an `Indexable` via `StaffIndexSource.toIndexable` and hands it to `Indexer.upsertEntries`. Staff are **not** walked by `rebuildFromStores` under normal operation (only on a full rebuild). If a staff entry is missing, check in order: (1) the project's `SearchService.getState()` is `"ready"` (not `"disabled"` / `"rebuilding"`); (2) `indexStaff` was called with the correct staff object (add a log in `StaffManager` or watch `[search]` log lines); (3) the `Indexer` progress emission shows the row was upserted (`index:progress` with a non-zero `completed` for the `incremental` phase).
- Sidebar filter not working? The sidebar uses client-side filtering only (no API calls). It matches goal titles, session titles, session agent roles, and staff names. Check `_applySearchFilter()` in `Sidebar.ts`
- Mobile sidebar showing every archived goal when a query is typed? `renderMobileLanding` in `src/app/render.ts` must route archived goals through `filterArchivedGoalsByQuery` and standalone archived sessions through `filterArchivedSessionsByQuery` (both in `src/app/render-helpers.ts`) — the same helpers desktop's `renderSidebar` uses. If mobile skips the filter, every archived goal leaks through regardless of the query.
- Matched substring not bolded in the sidebar? Goal titles, session titles/roles, and staff names render through `renderHighlightedText(text, state.searchQuery)` in `render-helpers.ts`. Empty/null query → plain text; non-empty query wraps every case-insensitive occurrence in `<strong class="font-semibold">`. Regex special chars in the query are escaped. If highlighting breaks layout, check that the wrapper stays inline and that the span does not introduce whitespace.
- Full search page (`#/search`) is the sole consumer of the FTS API — it manages its own state, independent from sidebar filtering
- Archived section not auto-opening on search match? Check `_archivedBySearch` flag — it distinguishes search-triggered expansion from manual clicks

## Sidebar child loading

Visibility is inherited — if a sidebar entry is visible (live, search match, or loaded via "See archived" + paging), all its children must be loaded. Three parent→child relationships are covered:

1. **Goal → sessions**: `teamGoalId` or `goalId` match
2. **Team lead → team members**: `teamLeadSessionId` match (coders, reviewers, QA agents)
3. **Session → delegates**: `delegateOf` chains (recursive)

Debugging checklist:
- Expanding a live goal shows no children? Check the server BFS enrichment in `GET /api/sessions` — it should seed from live goal IDs and walk `teamGoalId`/`goalId`, not just `delegateOf`
- Archived team members missing? The BFS must also walk `teamLeadSessionId` relationships from live session IDs
- Expanding an archived goal shows nothing? Check `GET /api/goals?archived=true` returns an `archivedSessions` field with affiliated sessions and their delegate chains
- Children appear briefly then vanish? The client must merge (not replace) archived sessions — check `fetchArchivedSessionsPaginated()` uses additive merge on first page, not `state.archivedSessions = []`
- Edge case: goal loaded via "Load more goals" has no children? The on-demand fallback in `renderGoalGroup` should fire a one-shot fetch to `GET /api/goals/:id/team/agents?include=archived`. Check the `_goalChildrenFetched` guard Set isn't stale — it's cleared by `clearGoalChildrenFetchedCache()` when toggling archived off

## Paginated archives

- Cursor based on `archivedAt` timestamp
- Missing items? Check `archivedAt` is set (older items may lack it)
- Count mismatch? Verify total from paginated response metadata
- Archived delegates disappearing on "Show Archived" toggle? The `?include=archived` path returns `archivedDelegates` via BFS enrichment — if they're missing, check that the server is running the child BFS on the archived response and the client is merging them into `state.archivedSessions`
- Per-project Archived subsections not persisting their collapsed state? Each project's Archived subsection defaults to expanded; collapsed project IDs are persisted in `localStorage["bobbit-archived-collapsed-projects"]` (mirrors `bobbit-collapsed-ungrouped` / `bobbit-collapsed-staff`). The global `bobbit-show-archived` toggle controls all per-project subsections at once
- Per-project Archived subsection empty for a project you expected to have items? Check in order: (1) `state.showArchived` is true (global toggle on) — if false, **every** project's subsection is suppressed; (2) `state.archivedSessions` / `state.archivedGoals` actually contain the items (paginated "Load more" may still be needed); (3) each item's `projectId` resolves to a registered project — items missing `projectId` or pointing at an unregistered project fall back to the **default** project's bucket with a `console.warn("[sidebar] archived goal/session missing projectId, using default", id)`. If a user reports "my archived items moved to the wrong project", that console warning is the signal.
- "Load more archived" button missing or in the wrong place? The pagination buttons are rendered **once** below the project list, not per project. They only appear when `state.showArchived` is on, there is no active search query, and `state.archivedGoalsHasMore` / `state.archivedSessionsHasMore` is true. See `src/app/sidebar.ts` around the `renderProjectArchivedSection` call site.

## Slash skill expansion

- Skills show in autocomplete but don't expand? The autocomplete API (`/api/slash-skills`) must receive the session's `projectId` so it resolves skills from the correct project's `config_directories`. Verify `AgentInterface.projectId` is set from session data in `session-manager.ts`
- Check server logs for `[ws-handler] Slash skill "<name>" not found for session <id> (cwd=<cwd>)` — this warning fires when a `/skill-name` pattern matches but `getSlashSkill()` returns undefined, indicating a project context mismatch or missing skill file
- In multi-project setups, each project's `config_directories` controls which skills are discovered. A skill defined in project B's config directory won't appear for sessions in project A

## Multi-project / per-project state

- State is per-project: goals, sessions, tasks, teams, gates, search, costs all live in `<project-root>/.bobbit/state/`
- `ProjectContextManager` manages all `ProjectContext` instances and routes store access
- Project registry at `<server-cwd>/.bobbit/state/projects.json` — check file exists and is valid JSON
- **No default project.** The server never auto-registers one. A fresh install has an empty `projects.json` and the UI forces Add Project before any goal/session work. `POST /api/goals`, `POST /api/sessions`, and `POST /api/staff` require an explicit `projectId` or a `cwd` matching a registered project's `rootPath` and return **400** `"projectId required: ..."` otherwise (see [rest-api.md — Project resolution contract](rest-api.md#project-resolution-contract)).
- `GET /api/projects` to list all registered projects
- Sessions/goals not appearing? Check `projectId` field matches the expected project. Verify the correct project's `sessions.json` / `goals.json` contains the record
- Sidebar not grouping? Project folder rows are always shown — check that `state.projects` is populated and `renderProjectHeader()` is being called
- Project registration failing? `rootPath` must be absolute and exist on disk; duplicate paths are rejected
- Search not filtering by project? Verify `?projectId=` query param is passed; each project has its own `search.flex/` index
- Config not cascading? Check all three `.bobbit/config/` directories (global, server, project) and verify `resolveScalarConfig()` / `resolveEntities()` return expected scope
- **State migration**: On first startup after upgrade, central state is distributed to per-project dirs. Check for `.bobbit/state/.migrated-to-per-project` marker. Central files renamed with `.pre-migration` suffix (not deleted). If migration didn't run, check that projects are registered before migration runs
- **Store routing bugs**: All store access must go through `ProjectContextManager` — direct `this.store` calls bypass per-project routing. `SessionManager` uses `resolveStoreForSession()` / `resolveStoreForId()` to find the correct per-project `SessionStore`
- **Known limitations**: `active-verifications.json` stays in the central state dir (transient operational state).

## Gate re-signal cancellation

- `cancelStaleVerifications()` in `verification-harness.ts` terminates old reviewer sessions and persists `status: "failed"` to the gate store
- Cancelled flag checked after `Promise.all` to suppress stale results
- Check `sessionManager` and `teamManager` passed to `VerificationHarness`
- Inspect: `GET /api/goals/:goalId/verifications/active`
- **Stuck verification?** Cancel manually via `POST /api/goals/:goalId/gates/:gateId/cancel-verification` (returns `{ cancelled: true }` or `{ cancelled: false }` if nothing was running). The goal dashboard also shows a Cancel button when a verification is in "running" state.
- **Zombie detection**: On re-signal, the server checks `areVerificationSessionsAlive()` before returning 409. If all reviewer sessions are dead, the stale verification is auto-cancelled and the new signal proceeds. Command steps (no `sessionId`) and waiting steps are treated as alive.

## Phased verification

- Steps are grouped by `phase` (integer, default 0) and phases execute sequentially
- Within each phase, steps run in parallel
- If any step in a phase fails, remaining phases are skipped (status: `"skipped"`)
- Skipped steps carry `skipped: true` on `GateSignalStep`, persisted in `gates.json` — this lets the UI show the correct dash icon after reload (without it, skipped steps would appear as passed or failed based on the `passed` field alone)
- `gate_verification_phase_started` WebSocket event fires before each phase
- Step events include `phase` field; skipped steps show `"Skipped — earlier phase failed"`
- Check `ActiveVerification.currentPhase` via `GET /api/goals/:goalId/verifications/active`
- If LLM reviews run when they shouldn't: verify `phase: 1` is set on `llm-review` steps in the workflow YAML

## Verification artifacts

- `llm-review` steps store full output as `text/markdown` artifacts on `GateSignalStep.artifact`
- Artifacts are capped at 10 MB; content truncated if exceeded
- Dashboard shows markdown artifacts in collapsible "Full Review" sections; HTML artifacts via "View Report" button
- If artifacts are missing: check that the `llm-review` step completed (not skipped/cancelled)
- Artifact data persists in `gates.json` alongside step results

## QA screenshot token bloat

- Symptom: QA session burns millions of cache-read tokens / dollars of cost, often killed by the context ceiling before it can submit a verdict.
- Root cause (pre-fix): `browser_screenshot(includeBase64: true)` returned the full `data:image/png;base64,...` URI as a text content block. It stayed in the transcript and was re-cached on every subsequent turn.
- Quick check: open the QA session's transcript and inspect a `browser_screenshot` tool result. Post-fix results contain `[screenshot_file]<absolute-path>[/screenshot_file]`. If you still see `[screenshot_base64]data:image/...[/screenshot_base64]`, the browser tool extension is stale — rebuild and restart the server.
- Spilled files live under `<session-cwd>/.bobbit-qa/screenshots/`. The directory is gitignored and deleted on session shutdown. If stale dirs remain after a crash, they are safe to `rm -rf`.
- Reports referencing screenshots via `<img src="file://...">` are inlined to base64 by the server when the agent submits via `report_html_file` (20 MB cumulative cap, session-cwd-scoped). See [qa-testing.md — Screenshots in QA reports](qa-testing.md#screenshots-in-qa-reports).
