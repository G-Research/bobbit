# Browser-dimension Chaos Comparison — Test Suite v2

Generated: 2026-07-07T22:58:42.704Z  |  Run duration: 3.2 min

Adversarial proof that the consolidated v2 **journeys** catch every browser-only
mutant the retired 184-spec **legacy** suite catches. Both tiers run the targeted
spec at `retries: 0` against a freshly rebuilt `dist`; attribution names the failing test.

## Summary

| Metric | Legacy suite | V2 journeys |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Content mutants | 2 | 2 |
| With targeted catchers | 2 | 2 |
| Caught | 2 | 2 |
| Missed | 0 | 0 |
| Invalid (did not compile) | 0 | 0 |
| Error (harness/env) | 0 | 0 |
| **Kill rate (of killable)** | **100.0%** | **100.0%** |

**Null-mutant integrity:** — (no null mutant this run)

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Every legacy-caught mutant is also journey-caught (no REAL hole):** ✅ PASS
- **V2 ≥ legacy overall (kill count):** ✅ PASS (v2 2 vs legacy 2)
- **Both-missed gaps:** ✅ None
- **All journey kills attributed to a specific test:** ✅ PASS (2/2)

## Per-area Comparison (v2 journeys ≥ legacy is the verdict)

| Area | Mutants | Legacy caught | V2 caught | Real journey miss | Inconclusive | v2 ≥ legacy (runnable) |
|------|---------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| project-onboarding-post-archive | 1 | 1 | 1 | — | — | ✅ |
| team-operations-archive-child-cascade | 1 | 1 | 1 | — | — | ✅ |

**Per-area v2 ≥ legacy:** ✅ PASS (no area has a real journey miss; ✅* = has env-inconclusive to re-run)

## Methodology

- Each mutant is a single search/replace in a browser-only `src/` file (see `tests2/chaos/browser-mutants.json`).
- Applied in ONE ephemeral `git worktree add --detach` shared across the campaign; the node_modules junction is unlinked before any recursive delete (junction-safe teardown).
- Browser tests run against BUILT `dist`, so each mutant rebuilds only its dist target(s) (`build:ui` / `build:server`); a previously-mutated target is rebuilt from clean source before the next mutant.
- A mutation that does not compile is `invalid` (never a kill); a run that crashes before tests is `error` (never a kill).
- `caught` requires a NAMED failing test in the Playwright JSON report — a bare non-zero exit is an error, not a kill.
- After each mutant the source file is reverted and a clean-tree assertion confirms no mutant leaks into the branch.
