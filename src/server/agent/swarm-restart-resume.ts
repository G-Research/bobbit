/**
 * SWARM-W2 — restart-resume for the hard governor (design/swarm-orchestration.md
 * §11 Wave 2: "restart-resume in `test:manual`"; carried forward explicitly by
 * `docs/design/swarm-orchestration-w1.md`'s "Deliberately NOT built this wave"
 * note: "a hard-killed governor timer does not re-arm on restart (the
 * `SwarmGovernor` instance is in-memory only)").
 *
 * `SwarmGovernor` (swarm-governor.ts) is a per-process, in-memory Map: every
 * `registerNode` call arms a straggler wall-clock timer and enables
 * turn-boundary token-budget enforcement for one swarm-sibling goal. A
 * gateway restart wipes that Map. Anything durable (the goal itself, the
 * `SwarmGroupStore` barrier/artifact record, the per-session cost history
 * `checkTokenBudget` reads from) survives fine — restart-durability of the
 * SPEND counter was already true before this module existed (§6 "restart-durable
 * spend counter" — the cost tracker persists per-session usage, so a re-armed
 * governor immediately sees the correct pre-restart cumulative total on the
 * next `message_end`). The ONLY gap is re-establishing the Map entry (and
 * re-arming the straggler timer against the ORIGINAL deadline, not a fresh
 * `wallClockMs` from the restart moment — a naive re-arm would let every
 * restart buy a straggler a fresh full wall-clock budget, defeating the
 * guarantee that a swarm always converges).
 *
 * This module scans every project's `SwarmGroupStore` at boot and re-registers
 * the governor for any sibling that is still in-flight (expected, but not yet
 * captured in the barrier's artifacts) — nothing more. It never resolves the
 * barrier itself, never mutates goal/session state, and is a pure best-effort
 * sweep: a goal that no longer exists (deleted) or is archived is silently
 * skipped, not treated as an error, since it means SOME other terminal path
 * already ran (or the goal was cleaned up) even though the artifact wasn't
 * captured — outside this module's job to reconcile.

 * time (the two happen back-to-back, synchronously, in
 * `createBestOfNSwarm` — see swarm-best-of-n.ts) so the straggler wall-clock
 * deadline is computed against elapsed REAL time, not reset to a fresh
 * `wallClockMs` on every restart. A sibling that was already past its
 * deadline during the downtime gets straggler-killed almost immediately
 * after boot rather than silently running ungoverned forever.
 *
 * Call once, at boot, after `projectContextManager.initAll()` and the
 * `VerificationHarness` construction have both completed (server.ts wires
 * this right after `verificationHarness` is constructed).
