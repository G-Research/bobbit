/**
 * Per-model thinking-level capabilities. Single source of truth shared
 * between the server (`src/server/`) and the UI (`src/app/`, `src/ui/`).
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. If the model carries upstream per-model metadata (`thinkingLevelMap`),
 *      trust it fully — this mirrors pi-ai's own `getSupportedThinkingLevels`
 *      (`@earendil-works/pi-ai`), the source of truth the agent runtime uses.
 *   2. Otherwise fall back to Bobbit's family heuristics for sparse model
 *      payloads (notably AI Gateway / fallback persisted state) that carry no
 *      `thinkingLevelMap`.
 *
 * Map-present rules (mirror pi-ai exactly):
 *   - `reasoning === false` → only "off".
 *   - A level whose map value is exactly `null` is DROPPED (explicitly
 *     unsupported). Notably `off: null` = forced adaptive thinking, so "off"
 *     is NOT selectable (e.g. Claude Fable 5 → minimal/low/medium/high/xhigh).
 *   - A level ABSENT from the map is KEPT (uses provider default), except
 *     "xhigh" and "max" which are kept only when present with a non-null value.
 *
 * Map-absent (heuristic) rules:
 *   - "off" is supported.
 *   - "minimal"/"low"/"medium"/"high" are supported iff `reasoning === true`.
 *   - "xhigh" is supported by:
 *       • Anthropic Claude Opus 4.6+ (claude-opus-4-6, claude-opus-4.8, …)
 *       • OpenAI gpt-5.1-codex-max
 *       • OpenAI gpt-5.2* / gpt-5.4* / gpt-5.5*
 *   - "max" is supported only when upstream per-model metadata explicitly lists it.
 *
 * Clamping (`clampThinkingLevel`) resolves the requested token (unknown →
 * "off"), returns it if supported, else steps **up** by rank to the
 * next-higher supported level, then down if none exists above. This preserves
 * Pi's clamp direction for maps that drop a middle or low level.
