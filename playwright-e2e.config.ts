/**
 * E2E test config: split into API (in-process) and browser (process-spawned) projects.
 *
 * API tests use in-process-harness.ts — the gateway runs in the same Node
 * process, eliminating ~5-8s of process spawn overhead per worker.
 *
 * Browser tests use gateway-harness.ts — they need a real spawned process
 * to serve static UI files and test process-level behaviors.
 *
 * Global setup ensures both server and UI are built (builds only what's missing).

// Retries policy:
//
//   Local development: retries: 0. Every flake must be root-caused and
//   fixed in place. No `@quarantine` tag, no quarantine project, no
//   `test.skip("flaky…")`. The quarantine project was deliberately removed
//   because it allowed flakes to accrue silently.
//
//   CI (process.env.CI set): retries: 2. The browser project currently
//   has ~60% clean-run rate due to cross-worker FS contention
//   (see goal: "E2E browser contention fix"). Without CI retries, ~40%
//   of goal-gate verifications fail spuriously and block goal progression.
//   This is a TEMPORARY accommodation — the goal exists to fix the
//   underlying contention; the CI retry should be removed once that lands.
