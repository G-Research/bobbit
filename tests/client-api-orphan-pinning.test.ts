/**
 * Pinning test — Finding W2.F (systemic merge-integrity countermeasure).
 *
 * BACKGROUND: forensic review of tonight's three integration merges
 * (b687d93d, eef210f3, a34f27e6) found at least 6 shipped features where the
 * SERVER route silently vanished during a merge while the CLIENT caller and
 * its TESTS survived as orphans — e.g. `src/app/settings-page.ts` still
 * calling `/api/claude-code/status` after the route was dropped, and
 * `tests/e2e/pack-runtimes-api.spec.ts` still exercising `/api/pack-runtimes`
 * with no server route left to hit. In every case the client side (and its
 * test coverage) kept "working" right up until a real request 404'd — no
 * build error, no type error, just a silent runtime break discovered late.
 *
 * This test is the durable countermeasure: it extracts every `/api/...`
 * path literally referenced from CLIENT code (`src/app/`, `src/ui/`) and
 * asserts each one resolves against the server's actual route surface
 * (`src/server/server.ts` + the delegate route modules it calls into — see
 * tests/helpers/server-route-surface.ts). If a future integration merge
 * drops a server route out from under a live client caller, this test goes
 * red immediately instead of waiting for a user to hit the 404.
 *
 * SCOPE — CLIENT CODE ONLY, not test files: an early prototype of this test
 * also scanned `tests/**` for `/api/...` literals and found ~638 unique
 * strings with ~268 "orphans" — the overwhelming majority were prose inside
 * `describe(...)`/`it(...)` test-description strings (e.g. a test titled
 * `"/api/goals — data-only child auto-start"`) or intentionally-bogus paths
 * used to assert 404s, not real client calls. That signal-to-noise ratio
 * makes a test-file burn-down list unworkable without a much smarter
 * "is this actually a fetch call" extractor. Scoping to `src/app/`/`src/ui/`
 * avoids that noise entirely — every literal found there is, in practice, a
 * real endpoint reference (route-building helper, fetch call, or
 * EventSource URL), not test prose.
 *
 * METHOD-BLIND BY DESIGN: unlike tests/prompt-api-drift.test.ts (method-aware
 * because prompt text always states a method, e.g. "GET /api/foo"), client
 * call sites don't reliably state their HTTP method next to the path
 * (`gatewayFetch(path, init)` — `init.method` is a separate, often-omitted
 * argument). This test only asserts the PATH resolves to some route,
 * regardless of method — which is the exact shape of the incident it guards
 * against (the whole route family vanishing), not method-level drift.
 *
 * EXTRACTION APPROACH: a small hand-rolled tokenizer (not a single regex)
 * walks each (comment-stripped) client file character-by-character to find
 * every backtick template literal and quoted string containing "/api/",
 * handling `${...}` interpolation per this codebase's conventions:
 *   - `${expr}` immediately preceded by `/` → a path param → normalized to
 *     the digit "0" (chosen over a letter so it also satisfies server
 *     routes matched by a `(\d+)` regex group, e.g. the tool-content
 *     endpoint's message/block indices — a letter placeholder would have
 *     failed that regex and misreported a live route as an orphan).
 *   - `${expr}` NOT preceded by `/`, before "/api/" has appeared in the
 *     literal yet → a base-URL prefix (e.g. `` `${window.location.origin}/api/health` ``)
 *     → dropped, scanning continues into the literal path after it.
 *   - `${expr}` NOT preceded by `/`, AFTER "/api/" has appeared → a dynamic
 *     query-string/suffix per this codebase's `${qs}` / `${suffix}`
 *     convention (e.g. `` `/api/search/stats${qs}` ``) → truncates the
 *     literal there; everything after is dropped rather than guessed at.
 * A naive single alternation regex over the whole file was tried first and
 * rejected: an escaped backtick or a nested template literal elsewhere in a
 * large file (e.g. `` `${qs ? `?${qs}` : ""}` `` in src/app/api.ts) desyncs
 * a global-regex scan, silently swallowing unrelated literals between the
 * mismatched delimiters. The tokenizer above parses nesting properly instead.
 *
 * See tests/helpers/server-route-surface.ts for what this test found (and
 * fixed) in the *server*-side extractor while validating this test's
 * results: single-quoted route matchers, multi-line `.match(...)` calls, and
 * whole delegate route modules that server.ts calls into — all previously
 * unhandled, all of which would have produced false-positive "orphans" here.

 *
 * Burn-down history (proof the discipline works): the list originally also
 * carried `/api/claude-code/status`, `/api/claude-code/status/refresh`, and
 * `/api/preferences/claude-code/confirmation` (the W2 forensic finding's
 * headline orphans). Their restoring PRs (#16/#18) merged into aj-current
 * mid-flight — and this test's burn-down assertion failed on rebase exactly
 * as designed, forcing their removal here. `/api/sessions/0/notify`
 * (W2.G(a) — src/app/api.ts's `notifyProposalDecision()`) was the next entry;
 * its restoring PR added the missing `POST /api/sessions/:id/notify` route
 * to server.ts, so it's removed here too.
 *
 * `/api/pack-runtimes` and its `/:id/start|stop|restart|logs|capabilities|down`
 * family (restoration W2.E, not yet started) are NOT listed here: as of this
 * writing no client code under src/app/ or src/ui/ references them at all —
 * only tests/e2e/pack-runtimes-api.spec.ts does, which is out of this test's
 * client-only scope (see module header). Once client UI wiring for pack
 * runtimes lands, add its call sites' paths here (or, if the route is
 * restored first, they'll simply pass with no burn-down entry needed).
